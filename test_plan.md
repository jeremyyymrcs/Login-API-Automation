# Feature Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan for the **"Forgot Password"** feature in the application. The feature includes:

- An input field for the user to enter their email (`id="forgotEmail"`).
- A "Submit" button (`id="submitForgotPassword"`).
- A confirmation message (`id="confirmationMessage"`) that appears when the email is successfully submitted.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Valid Email Submission
- Verify that the user can successfully submit their email address for password recovery.

### 2. Invalid Email Submission
- Verify that an error message appears when an invalid email format is entered.

### 3. Empty Email Submission
- Verify that an error message is displayed when the user tries to submit without entering an email address.

### 4. Email Submission with Non-Registered Email
- Verify that the user is informed if they submit an email address not associated with any account.

### 5. Successful Confirmation Message Display
- Verify that the confirmation message appears upon successful email submission.
